# Deploy the application
railway up --detach

# Check deployment status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs --tail
```

## 🎯 OPTION 2: One-Line Deploy Command
After logging in, run this single command:
```bash
railway link -p 2a8f8a3d-0572-44ef-b251-a3d9556ef003 -e e2f932dd-e370-42e3-86dd-8930a9290a1c && railway up --detach
```

## 🎯 OPTION 3: Deploy from Railway Dashboard

1. Go to your Railway project: https://railway.app/project/2a8f8a3d-0572-44ef-b251-a3d9556ef003
2. Click on **"Settings"** → **"Service"**
3. Under **"Source"**, connect to GitHub:
   - Repository: `SolomonLincolnJr/webdevelopment`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Root Directory: `/` (leave empty)
4. Click **"Deploy"**

## 🎯 OPTION 4: Use Deployment Script
I've created deployment scripts in your repo:

```bash
# Full deployment with status messages
./railway-deploy.sh

# Quick one-line deployment
./railway-quick-deploy.sh
```

## 📋 Environment Variables to Set in Railway

Go to your Railway project dashboard and add these variables:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000

# Optional but recommended
DD_API_KEY=your_datadog_api_key
DD_APP_KEY=your_datadog_app_key
GENSPARK_API_KEY=your_genspark_api_key
```

## 🔧 Railway CLI with Token (Alternative)

If you have a Railway token, you can deploy without browser login:

```bash
# Set your Railway token
export RAILWAY_TOKEN=your_railway_token_here

# Deploy directly
railway link -p 2a8f8a3d-0572-44ef-b251-a3d9556ef003 -e e2f932dd-e370-42e3-86dd-8930a9290a1c
railway up --detach
```

## 🎯 GitHub Actions Automation

To enable automatic deployment on every push:

1. Get your Railway token:
   - Go to: https://railway.app/account/tokens
   - Create new token
   - Copy the token

2. Add to GitHub Secrets:
   - Go to: https://github.com/SolomonLincolnJr/webdevelopment/settings/secrets/actions
   - Add new secret: `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
   - Paste your token

3. Create workflow file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
```yaml
name: Deploy to Railway
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm install -g @railway/cli
      - run: railway link -p 2a8f8a3d-0572-44ef-b251-a3d9556ef003 -e e2f932dd-e370-42e3-86dd-8930a9290a1c
      - run: railway up --detach
    env:
      RAILWAY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN }}
```

## ✅ Verification After Deployment

Once deployed, verify your platform:

```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl https://webdevelopment-production-023f.up.railway.app/health

# Check API status
curl https://webdevelopment-production-023f.up.railway.app/api/status

# View metrics
curl https://webdevelopment-production-023f.up.railway.app/api/metrics
```
