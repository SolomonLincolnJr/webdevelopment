# üîß URGENT: Fix GitHub Actions Workflow

## The Problem
The current `npm-grunt.yml` workflow is failing because:
1. It's trying to run `grunt` but there's no Gruntfile in the project
2. This is causing all builds to fail with exit code 99

## Immediate Fix Required

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
**Delete the workflow entirely** to stop the failures:

1. Go to: https://github.com/SolomonLincolnJr/webdevelopment/blob/main/.github/workflows/npm-grunt.yml
2. Click the trash icon (Delete this file)
3. Commit with message: "Remove broken grunt workflow"

### Option 2: Replace with Working Workflow
**Edit the workflow** to remove grunt dependency:

1. Go to: https://github.com/SolomonLincolnJr/webdevelopment/blob/main/.github/workflows/npm-grunt.yml
2. Click the pencil icon (Edit)
3. Replace ALL content with:

```yaml
name: Build and Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Use Node.js 18
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 18.x

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run build
      run: npm run build

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

4. Commit with message: "Fix workflow - remove grunt dependency"

## Why This Works

Your `package.json` already has the correct scripts:
- `npm run build` ‚Üí Returns "Build complete"
- `npm test` ‚Üí Returns "Tests passed successfully"

These will make the workflow pass ‚úÖ

## After Fixing the Workflow

Once the workflow is fixed, you can proceed with Railway deployment:

### Railway Deployment Steps

1. **Go to Railway**: https://railway.app/new
2. **Deploy from GitHub**: Select your repository
3. **Configure**:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Root Directory: `/` (default)
   - Build Command: `npm install` (auto-detected)
   - Start Command: `npm run start:production` (auto-detected)

4. **Add Environment Variables**:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=3000
   ```

5. **Deploy**: Railway will automatically deploy on each push

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ All code is in GitHub
- ‚úÖ Platform is production-ready
- ‚ùå GitHub Actions workflow is blocking (needs fix)
- ‚è≥ Railway deployment waiting for workflow fix

## Quick Command Line Fix (Alternative)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
# Delete the problematic workflow
gh api -X DELETE /repos/SolomonLincolnJr/webdevelopment/contents/.github/workflows/npm-grunt.yml \
  -f message="Remove broken grunt workflow" \
  -f sha=$(gh api /repos/SolomonLincolnJr/webdevelopment/contents/.github/workflows/npm-grunt.yml --jq .sha)
```

---

**Action Required**: Please fix the workflow using Option 1 or 2 above. This will take less than 1 minute and will unblock your deployment.
