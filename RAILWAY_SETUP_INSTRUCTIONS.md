# üöÇ Railway Deployment Setup Instructions

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Code Successfully Deployed to GitHub**
‚ö†Ô∏è **GitHub Actions Workflow Issue**: The npm-grunt workflow is failing (no Grunt configuration)
‚úÖ **Package.json Updated**: Test scripts now pass successfully

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix GitHub Actions Workflow
Since the GitHub App can't modify workflows, you need to manually update via GitHub web interface:

1. Go to: https://github.com/SolomonLincolnJr/webdevelopment/blob/main/.github/workflows/npm-grunt.yml
2. Click "Edit this file" (pencil icon)
3. Replace the entire content with:

```yaml
name: Build and Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci || npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
      
    - name: Validate platform
      run: npm run validate
```

4. Commit with message: "Fix workflow to use npm test instead of grunt"

### 2. Connect Railway to GitHub

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app/
2. **Create New Project** or use existing
3. **Deploy from GitHub**:
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select `SolomonLincolnJr/webdevelopment`
   - Choose `main` branch

### 3. Configure Railway Environment Variables

In Railway project settings, add these environment variables:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000

# Datadog Configuration (Optional)
DD_API_KEY=your_datadog_api_key
DD_APP_KEY=your_datadog_app_key
DD_SERVICE=psyberherd-apex-sniper
DD_ENV=production

# GenSpark Configuration (Required for full functionality)
GENSPARK_API_KEY=your_genspark_api_key
GENSPARK_API_URL=https://api.genspark.ai/v1

# Trading Configuration (Optional)
TRADING_MODE=paper
MAX_POSITION_SIZE=100000
RISK_PERCENTAGE=2
```

### 4. Railway Service Configuration

Railway should automatically detect and use:
- **Build Command**: `npm install` (from nixpacks.toml)
- **Start Command**: `npm run start:production` (from railway.toml)
- **Health Check**: `/health` endpoint

### 5. Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

To use the specific domain `webdevelopment-production-023f.up.railway.app`:

1. In Railway project settings
2. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
3. Add custom domain or use generated Railway domain
4. Update CORS settings if needed

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Deployment Status
```bash
# Once deployed, verify health
curl https://webdevelopment-production-023f.up.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "service": "PSYBERHERD‚Ñ¢ APEX Sniper",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

### 2. Test API Endpoints
```bash
# System status
curl https://webdevelopment-production-023f.up.railway.app/api/status

# Performance metrics
curl https://webdevelopment-production-023f.up.railway.app/api/metrics

# Trading signals (WebSocket)
wscat -c wss://webdevelopment-production-023f.up.railway.app/stream
```

### 3. Monitor Logs
In Railway dashboard:
- Click on your service
- Go to "Logs" tab
- Watch for startup messages

Expected log output:
```
[GenSpark] AI Co-Engineer initialized
[Orchestration] Dynamic orchestration engine started
[Quantum] Processing engine initialized (fidelity: 0.8677)
[QA] Quality assurance system active
[Trading] APEX Sniper engine ready
[Server] PSYBERHERD‚Ñ¢ APEX API running on port 3000
```

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:

1. **Check Build Logs**: Look for npm install errors
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure PORT is set
3. **Check Start Command**: Should use `npm run start:production`
4. **Memory Issues**: Railway free tier has 512MB limit

### If health check fails:

1. Service may still be starting (wait 60 seconds)
2. Check if PORT environment variable is set
3. Verify no port conflicts

### If API returns errors:

1. Check if GENSPARK_API_KEY is configured
2. Verify all required dependencies installed
3. Check Railway logs for specific error messages

## Direct Railway CLI Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer command-line deployment:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to project
railway link

# Deploy
railway up

# Check logs
railway logs
```

- **Railway Documentation**: https://docs.railway.app/
- **Railway Status**: https://status.railway.app/
- **GitHub Actions Status**: Check the Actions tab in your repository
- **Repository**: https://github.com/SolomonLincolnJr/webdevelopment

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
1. ‚úÖ Health endpoint returns 200 OK
2. ‚úÖ API endpoints respond with data
3. ‚úÖ WebSocket connections establish
4. ‚úÖ Logs show all services initialized
5. ‚úÖ No error messages in Railway logs
